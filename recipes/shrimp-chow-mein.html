    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This shrimp chow mein is delicious — it tastes just like takeout! The flavors are spot-on, the vegetables are slightly crunchy, and the sauce is light but enough to coat the noodles, veggies, and shrimp.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces chow mein noodles</li>
        <li>Quarter cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry sherry</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>One and a half tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon light brown sugar</li>
        <li>Quarter teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>Half cup matchstick carrots</li>
        <li>Half cup thinly sliced onion</li>
        <li>Half stalk celery, diagonally sliced</li>
        <li>One and a half tablespoons finely chopped fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic</li>
        <li>Three quarters of a pound of uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 cup bean sprouts</li>
        <li>4 stalks green onions, thinly sliced on the diagonal</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh baby spinach</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain, rinse, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk together chicken stock, sherry, oyster sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, and pepper in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat a large 12-inch cast iron skillet or wok over medium-high heat until hot. Add canola oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan; heat until it just begins to smoke. Add carrots, onion, celery, ginger, and garlic to hot oil and cook, stirring constantly, just until vegetables begin to soften, about 1 minute. Add shrimp and cook, stirring constantly, until almost done, about 2 minutes. Push vegetables and shrimp to one side of the pan and add chicken stock mixture; stir constantly until sauce is hot.</li>
        <li>Add noodles and stir well to mix with sauce and vegetables (using a metal spatula and chopping noodles slightly helps to mix this together.) Cook, stirring constantly, until the noodles have absorbed the sauce, about 2 minutes. Stir in bean sprouts and green onions and cook, stirring constantly, until just cooked, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in baby spinach until just wilted. Serve immediately.</li>
