# odin-recipes
This project is a part of The Odin Project Foundations HTML
portion. It will have a homepage with links to a few recipes.
This is just to practice html and should not look pretty.

After the completion of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:
 - HTML basics (boilerplate, lists, hyperlinks, images)
 - Git and GitHub basics (status, add, commit, log, clone, push)
